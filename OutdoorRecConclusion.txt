Conclusion

Based on the results of the graphs, I have concluded that Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood for the most amount of Outdoor Recreation. Out of all the neighborhoods, it has the greatest number of playgrounds and number of courts/rinks. It also has lots of playing fields, and a pool too. Another good options include Highland Park, Southside Slopes, Hazelwood, and Beechview if you are looking for a nice variety of all activities. Brighton Heights is a good option if you are only interested in playing fields. Brookline is a good option if you don't care about playgrounds and want to stick to courts/rinks and playing fields.
