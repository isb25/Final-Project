According to the combined datasets in the “Crime in Neighborhoods” graph, Mt. Oliver had the least amount of crime,
making it the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh by a significant amount. The overall winner, Squirrel Hill South, did not
even make it to the ten safest neighborhoods. Although not shown in our final report, it was actually among the top ten in 
terms of the number of police incidents, so I was surprised to see it win overall. However, speaking from personal experience,
it is one of my favorite neighborhoods, so I can understand how it did well enough in terms of the environment to bring
it’s overall score up enough that it won for the best overall neighborhood. Although I still believe Mt. Oliver is safest due to 
its overwhelming lack of police incidents compared to other neighborhoods, it’s clear from the data that it did not perform 
well enough in the environment metric to make it to the top best neighborhoods overall.
