According to our results, Squirrel Hill South was our overall winner for best neighborhood. This is not consistent with my results as I had Shadyside on top in my data, but Squirrel Hill South was in the top 10 of my data so it does make sense of how it came up on top.
The runner-up for best overall neighboor was Shadyside. I didn't think that was that odd, data wise, because it was the best neighborhood in the two datasets that I had analyzed. But, personally, I find that quite odd, as I have been to Shadyside several times and I
wouldn't say that the neighborhood is one of the bests. Overall, I agree that Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
