Individual Conclusion (James)

According to our results, Squirrel Hill South was our overall winner for best neighborhood. This is consistent with my results too, since Squirrel Hill South was also the best choice for outdoor recreation. 
The runner-up for best overall neighboor was Shadyside. I thought this was strange, because Shadyside was not even amongst the top 10 neighborhoods for outdoor recreation. I think this shows that if you are someone that does not care for outdoor recreation, Shadyside might be a better option for you overall. 
The same can be said about Bloomfield and North Shore, since they did not rank high in outdoor recreation yet were still among the best overall neighborhoods. It all depends on preference and how much you personally value outdoor recreation.
Overall, I also agree that Squirrel Hill South is the best overall neighborhood.
